            <h3>Chadiza District</h3>
            <p>CHADIZA, which was established in 1949, is the second district to be created in Eastern Province and is among the oldest, yet the most underdeveloped district in the country.Chadiza lies about 35 kilometres south of the Great East Road and about 80 km south-west of Chipata, on a plateau studded by isolated rocky hills, between the middle Luangwa valley and the Zambezi.Chadiza lies in the extreme south-east corner of Zambia, bordering Mozambique to its south. The eastern half of the district is characterised by wooded rocky hills rising to 1330 m while the western half has the same character as the land around Chadiza town. This part of the district has been almost completely deforested and suffers soil erosion. In 2012, most of the eastern part of the district was declared its own district, namely Vubwi District.

            <h3>Chama District</h3>
            <p>is the largest district of the Eastern Province in Zambia and includes a large wilderness in the Upper Luangwa valley just north-east of the North Luangwa National Park. It is made up of two constituencies, namely Chama North and Chama South.Much of the population of Chama District lives close to the Malawi border and shares tribal and cultural links with the people of the northern highlands of that country. The people of Chama belong mostly to the Senga tribe. Members of the Tumbuka tribe also live in Chama. Chisenga, a language similar to ChiTumbuka and Chichewa or Nyanja, is the predominant language spoken.[citation needed].Agriculture is the leading industry, and maize is the most common crop. Chama is also known as a rice-growing area. Cotton is a lucrative crop for some. Sorghum and soyabeans are also grown. Other common food crops include groundnuts, sweet potatoes, pumpkin, cabbage, sunflowers.In 2012, President Michael Sata created a new province in Zambia, namely Muchinga Province. Every district of Muchinga Province was formerly part of the Northern Province, except for Chama District, which was formerly part of the Eastern Province.Nine years later, on 17 November 2021, President Hakainde Hichilema announced his intention to reverse the decision to move Chama District from Eastern Province.[3] President Hichilema officially declared Chama District as part of Eastern Province (no-longer part of Muchinga Province), thereby returning the district to its original province</p>

This cornerstone has left the town as the hub of Eastern Province, by maintaining its position as a Provincial Headquarters.Chipata was declared a city on 24 February 2017 (no-longer a town).</p>

       <h4>Information And Communication University | MISSION</h4>
       <p>The Information and Communications University‚Äôs mission is to offer education tailored towards problem solving. ‚ÄúProblem-solving is cognitive processing directed at achieving a goal when no solution method is obvious to the problem solver‚Äù. This will set a strong foundation for ICTs spurts in Zambia. Currently, the type of ICT education being emphasised in the newly revised curriculum is that of teaching learners how to merely use the already developed ICTs by other countries rather than stimulating invention, creativity and innovation among the learners. The problem-solving education approach will inspire learners into critical thinking, creative thinking, reasoning and decision making; hence learners will benefit by developing skills and ability to apply these skills to unfamiliar situation ,Gathering, organising, interpreting and communicating information,Formulating key questions, analysing & conceptualizing problems, defining problems and goals, discovering patterns and similarities, seeking out appropriate data, experimenting, transferring skills and strategies to new situations and developing curiosity, confidence, and open mindedness.</p><p>In order to perform a new and challenging paradigm of education, ICU shall employ and develop various specialization strategies that are innovative and distinguished from the existing educational patterns, among them: to ensure that every graduating student has published an academic research paper in an international journal, to ensure that every student becomes innovative, research oriented and a problem-solver.ICU is also working in collaboration with National Research University ‚ÄúMoscow Power Engineering Institute‚Äù, Moscow, Russia in the field of scientific research, teaching innovation, teaching staff members exchange, student exchange, and joint education programs.</p>
